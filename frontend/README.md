## Testing

For testing i'm using the most popular tool called **Cypress**. Testing instructions are not really described in details. But at this stage, emotion can be satisfied with it.

### Instructions

1.  Run **Cypress** with the command `>= yarn cypress`. Now it will open an window consist of all the testing file.
2.  Select one testing file after another & there will be a window popped up.
3.  Enjoy testing. And be happy!
    _It's really easy right? I think so too._
